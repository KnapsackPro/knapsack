# Do you use Heroku?

Do you know Knapsack Pro Ruby gem is available as Heroku add-on? It works with your current CI server.
https://elements.heroku.com/addons/knapsack-pro

Knapsack Pro has Queue Mode that will split Ruby & JS tests in a dynamic way across parallel CI nodes to ensure each parallel job takes a similar time. Thanks to that there is no bottleneck in your CI pipelines.
